## My open-source projects 

### Sh

[Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) is the simplest way to run shell commands from your Swift code. It supports `async` and synchronous execution. 

It's architected as a wrapper around Foundation's `Process` type. This approaches makes the code flexible for your whatever your use-case is.

### SPX & Sh

[SPX](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/SPX) is a Swift script running tool. SPX pairs nicely with [Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) to run shell commands and process shell output from your Swift scripts.

This pull request https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/ios-base/pull/14 really shows off the power of scripting in Swift. Run `spx screenshots` to run the UI test target, taking screenshots, and processing them with `CoreGraphics` and `AVFoundation` to prepare the screenshots for the App Store and publishing to a website



### FQAuth

An open-source Sign-in with Apple server. [FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth) is the main server and middleware. 

#### Sample usage

- [Sample iOS app](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-iOS) 
- [Sample Vapor microservice](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-Microservice)

## My apps

Good ideas are useless (i.e. no one can use them) unless they're made concrete. Try out my ideas for yourself in my apps.

- [Haptics Studio](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1624792731) helps you discover the perfect customized haptics for your iOS app
- [Underway](https://underway.nyc/download) is the best app for underground decision-making in NYC
