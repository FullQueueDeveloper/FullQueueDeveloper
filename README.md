# Full Queue Developer

Multiplatform software developer with elevated sense of usability and ergonomics. Curious & gentle.

Watch real apps come to life: Season 2 now live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/FullQueueDeveloper) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@FullQueueDeveloper). Schedules posted in [Discord](https://discord.gg/gGmBNcDxrf) and other socials.

I love building things. My main medium is Swift, in iOS apps and server apps, and command-line tools. I also enjoy making food, making music, and making beaver dams in [Timberborn](https://mechanistry.com)

## My open-source projects 

### Swish & Sh



[Swish](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Swish) is a Swift script running tool. Swish pairs nicely with [Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) to run shell commands and process shell output from your Swift scripts.

This pull request https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/ios-base/pull/14 really shows off the power of scripting in Swift. Run `swish screenshots` to run the UI test target, taking screenshots, and processing them with `CoreGraphics` and `AVFoundation` to prepare the screenshots for the App Store and publishing to a website



### FQAuth

An open-source Sign-in with Apple server. [FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth) is the main server and middleware.
