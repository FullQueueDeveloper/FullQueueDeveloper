### Streaming schedule

## My open-source projects 

### SPX & Sh



[SPX](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/SPX) is a Swift script running tool. Swish pairs nicely with [Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) to run shell commands and process shell output from your Swift scripts.

This pull request https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/ios-base/pull/14 really shows off the power of scripting in Swift. Run `swish screenshots` to run the UI test target, taking screenshots, and processing them with `CoreGraphics` and `AVFoundation` to prepare the screenshots for the App Store and publishing to a website



### FQAuth

An open-source Sign-in with Apple server. [FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth) is the main server and middleware. 

#### Sample usage

- [Sample iOS app](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-iOS) 
- [Sample Vapor microservice](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-Microservice)

## Swift Macros

Swift Macros were introduced in Swift 5.9. Now that Swift 5.9 is live, these projects have reached 1.0 status.

### IdentifiedEnumCases
Reference enum cases directly, despite having an associated value! <br />

## My apps

Good ideas are useless (i.e. no one can use them) unless they're made concrete.

- [Haptics Studio](https://FullQueueDeveloper.com/haptics-studio) for iOS
- [Underway](https://underway.nyc) for iOS and Android
