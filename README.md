# Full Queue Developer

Creating is a miracle, programming is a joy

## Thanks to my sponsors here on GitHub!
Foremost, a huge heartfelt thank you to my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/FullQueueDeveloper)! I would not be here without you, thank you so so much üíú

## Live shows

I produce two live shows on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/FullQueueDeveloper).

**Living the Creative Act**<br/> 
*Sundays, 2pm NYC time* <br/> Book club reading and discussing "The Creative Act" by Rick Rubin. I read the section out loud before discussion, so you can come as you are. Can't make it to the live show? Catch the episodes on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/living-the-creative-act/id1710679124). More info and RSS feed [on my website](https://FullQueueDeveloper.com/living-the-creative-adt).


**Edges of Manhattan**<br/> 
*Weedays, 10am to 4pm NYC time* <br/> 
Sit with me, Wwork with me, chill with me, listen to music. Accompianied by my gentle NYC waterway scenery videos thoughout the workday. This is exactly what I want to watch while working. I've looked high and low for something like this, and I'm happy to bring this to you.

## My open-source projects 

### Sh

[Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) is the simplest way to run shell commands from your Swift code. It supports `async` and synchronous execution. 

It's architected as a wrapper around Foundation's `Process` type. This approaches makes the code flexible for your whatever your use-case is.

### SPX & Sh

[SPX](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/SPX) is a Swift script running tool. SPX pairs nicely with [Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) to run shell commands and process shell output from your Swift scripts.

This pull request https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/ios-base/pull/14 really shows off the power of scripting in Swift. Run `spx screenshots` to run the UI test target, taking screenshots, and processing them with `CoreGraphics` and `AVFoundation` to prepare the screenshots for the App Store and publishing to a website



### FQAuth

An open-source Sign-in with Apple server. [FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth) is the main server and middleware. 

#### Sample usage

- [Sample iOS app](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-iOS) 
- [Sample Vapor microservice](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-Microservice)

## Swift Macros

Swift Macros were introduced in Swift 5.9. Now that Swift 5.9 is live, these projects have reached 1.0 status.

### IdentifiedEnumCases
Reference enum cases directly, despite having an associated value! <br />

### StaticMemberIterable
Like 'CaseIterable' for static members! <br />

### UniquelyTypedId
Help the compiler help you notice when you pass the wrong type of ID! <br />

## My apps

Good ideas are useless (i.e. no one can use them) unless they're made concrete. Try out my ideas for yourself in my apps.

- [Haptics Studio](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1624792731) helps you discover the perfect customized haptics for your iOS app
- [Underway](https://underway.nyc/download) is the best app for underground decision-making in NYC
