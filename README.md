# Full Queue Developer

Watch real apps come to life: Season 2 now live on Twitch [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/FullQueueDeveloper) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@FullQueueDeveloper)

I love building things. My main medium is Swift, in iOS apps and server apps, and command-line tools. I also enjoy making food, making music, and making beaver dams in [Timberborn](https://mechanistry.com)

## My open-source projects 

### Swish & Sh

[Swish](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Swish) is a Swift script running tool. Easily run Swift packages in a supporting relative dir named Swish

Swish pairs nicely with [Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) to run shell commands and process shell output from your Swift scripts.

For a full example of using Swish, Sh, and ShXcrun on your iOS project, please see https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/SwishExampleiOSProject


### FQAuth

An open-source Sign-in with Apple server. [FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth) is the main server and middleware.
