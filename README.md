## My open-source projects 

### Swish & Sh



[Swish](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Swish) is a Swift script running tool. Swish pairs nicely with [Sh](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/Sh) to run shell commands and process shell output from your Swift scripts.

This pull request https://github.com/0xOpenBytes/ios-base/pull/14 really shows off the power of scripting in Swift. Run `swish screenshots` to run the UI test target, taking screenshots, and processing them with `CoreGraphics` and `AVFoundation` to prepare the screenshots for the App Store and publishing to a website



### FQAuth

An open-source Sign-in with Apple server. [FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth) is the main server and middleware. 

#### Sample usage

- [Sample iOS app](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-iOS) 
- [Sample Vapor microservice](https://github.com/FullQueueDeveloper/FQAuth-Sample-Microservice)
